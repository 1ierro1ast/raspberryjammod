Raspberry Jam Mod - a Mod Forge Minecraft 1.8 mod implementing most of Raspberry Juice/Pi API

To install for single-player and LAN use (as well as for client-side use with a server):
 1. Set up a Minecraft 1.8 (exactly this version) profile and run it once.
 2. Install the lastest version of Minecraft Forge for 1.8 (http://files.minecraftforge.net/)
 3. Put RaspberryJamMod.jar in your .minecraft/mods folder
 4. Put the sample scripts in in your .minecraft/mcpipy directory.
 5. Install Python if you need to.
On Windows, steps 3-5 can be automated by using the .exe installer.

To install on a server:
 1. Set up and run a Minecraft 1.8 server:
    https://s3.amazonaws.com/Minecraft.Download/versions/1.8/minecraft_server.1.8.jar
 2. Download a forge-1.8-xxxx-universal.jar (http://files.minecraftforge.net/) file
    and put it in the same folder as your minecraft_server_1.8.jar file.
 3. Create a mods/ folder in that folder and put RaspberryJamMod.jar there.
 4. Put the sample scripts in a mcpipy/ subfolder of the same folder as your minecraft server.
 5. Instead of running minecraft_server_1.8.jar to start the server, run forge-1.8-xxxx-universal.jar
